This is the first Hackathon made at the Wild Code School. (24h)

The subject was to create a "fighting game". We took the data of the characters from an API, and we developped a system where fighters can make an attack, have damaged and lose when HP fall to 0.

The team was composed of 5 Bakc-end students (PHP).
